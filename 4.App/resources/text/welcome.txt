Welcome to the Carbon Emission Calculator !

Our tool is designed to help you estimate carbon emissions at construction sites across five key stages:

1. Production Stage (Emissions from raw material production)
2. Transportation of raw materials (Emissions from transporting raw materials to factories)
3. Manufacturing of raw materials (Emissions from the manufacturing process)
4. Transportation of materials to the construction site (Emissions from transporting materials to the site)
5. Construction activities on site (Emissions from on-site construction activities)

By providing accurate insights into your carbon footprint at each stage, we empower you to make informed decisions for a more sustainable construction process.
